## HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor 
### (Bootcamp Challenge 01)


## Description
As part of the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp hosted by the University of New Brunswick @unb.ca through edx Online Learning @edx.org, we were provided with a mock on-the-job ticket and starter code to modify and neaten for a company that provides services catered to search engine optimisation, online reputation management, and social media marketing. The "user" in this case is a company cleverly called Hori<strong>seo</strong>n, and it wants a website that follows the following parameters:

### User Story
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
Must resemble the following image:
